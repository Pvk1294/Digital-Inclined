### üìù Project Overview & Business Problem

The project was to build a specialized, in-house **CRM and Facebook Ads Reporting Dashboard**. The core business problem was a highly inefficient and error-prone manual reporting process. Managers spent hours every week manually downloading Facebook Ads data into spreadsheets, calculating key metrics, and building reports by hand.

This tool solves that problem by **automating the entire workflow**, providing a centralized, reliable source of truth for ad performance and saving significant time and resources.

### üöÄ My Key Contributions & Responsibilities

As a Backend & DevOps Engineer, I was entrusted with significant responsibilities across the full project lifecycle.

* **Full-Stack Development:** Architected and developed the system's core backend logic using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Prisma** for seamless communication with the **PostgreSQL** database. I also contributed to building frontend components in **React.js**.

* **Secure Authentication:** Implemented a robust, **JWT-based authentication system** (access and refresh tokens) from scratch, ensuring secure access for both CRM Managers and Super Admins.

* **Facebook Graph API Integration:** Engineered the service layer responsible for connecting to the Facebook Graph API, fetching campaign data, and synchronizing it with our internal database.

* **Advanced Data Processing:** Developed a key feature that intelligently parses ad campaign names to identify product keywords. This allowed for **automated, product-level performance aggregation** (grouping spend, leads, CPL), a critical business requirement that was previously a manual task.

* **Access Control & Admin Logic:** Built the entire Super Admin module, including the crucial **access control logic** that allows administrators to assign specific Meta Business Accounts to individual CRM Managers, ensuring data segregation and security.

* **Cloud Deployment & DevOps:** Deployed and managed the full-stack application on a cloud infrastructure, utilizing **Firebase** for the frontend and a **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM** for the backend and a **Cloud SQL** instance for the PostgreSQL database.

* **Security Implementation:** Ensured data integrity and security by implementing **SHA-256 hashing** for all sensitive credentials and user data stored in the database.

### üìà Quantifiable Impact

My work on this project directly led to significant operational improvements:

* **Drastic Time Savings:** Automated the end-to-end reporting workflow, **reducing the time required to generate client reports from several hours of manual work to just a few minutes.**
* **100% Data Accuracy:** **Eliminated manual data entry and calculation errors**, providing a reliable and consistent source for all performance metrics.
* **Enhanced Security & Control:** Provided a granular, admin-controlled access system, ensuring users could only view data from the ad accounts assigned to them.
* **Centralized Reporting:** Created a unified dashboard that became the single source of truth for Facebook Ads performance across the company.
